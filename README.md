# Folder_Shortcut-GUI-using-Python

When I turn ON my Laptop to work it takes too much time to start up.
And I need to open any folder resides in my Drive that is another headache as it takes some time to open that folder as Laptop is slow.
Also I wanted to have some shortcut of perticular folder I opened everyday so that I can avoid going their location to open that again and again.
I created an User Interface using Python. Libraries used are Tkinter and OS. 
I used Pyinstaller to create an executable app.(that is .exe file)
